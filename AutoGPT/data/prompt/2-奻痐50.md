This is an xlsx file. The table structure is as follows: the first row is the table header, the first column is the company name, and the last column is the time. Starting from the second row, every four rows are grouped together, corresponding to the financial reports of this company in four time periods. Please confirm the table structure using a code interpreter (read the first nine rows) and tell me the contents of the table header after confirmation.
