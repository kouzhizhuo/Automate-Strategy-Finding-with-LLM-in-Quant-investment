Please correlate the earnings reports of the 50 listed companies represented by the SSE 50 for a certain number of quarters with the performance of a given Alpha Factor in the SSE 50 for the quarter following those quarters, and learn how to predict which Alpha to use for trading in the next quarter following those quarters, when you are given the earnings reports of the 50 companies in the SSE 50 for the previous quarters. Below I will upload, in sequence, the earnings reports of the 50 listed companies represented in the SSE 50 from December 31, 2021 to September 30, 2022 and the factor performance of different Alpha in the SSE 50 for the period September 30, 2022 to December 31, 2022. Please study the relationship between them so that you can deduce which Alpha will be suitable for trading from 09/30/2023 to 12/31/2023 after you are given the earnings reports of the 50 companies in the SSE 50 for four quarters from 12/31/2022 to 12/30/2023.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
To proceed with your task, please begin by uploading the earnings reports of the 50 listed companies represented in the SSE 50 from December 31, 2021, to September 30, 2022, followed by the factor performance data of different Alpha in the SSE 50 for the period from September 30, 2022, to December 31, 2022. This data will allow me to analyze the relationship and deduce the suitable Alpha for trading for the quarter ending December 31, 2023, based on the earnings reports from December 31, 2022, to September 30, 2023.

This is an xlsx file. The table structure is as follows: the first row is the table header, the first column is the company name, and the last column is the time. Starting from the second row, every four rows are grouped together, corresponding to the financial reports of this company in four time periods. Please confirm the table structure using a code interpreter (read the first nine rows) and tell me the contents of the table header after confirmation.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The table structure is confirmed to be as follows:

### Table Header
1. 股票简称 (Company Name)
2. 每股收益 (Earnings Per Share)
3. 营业收入-营业收入 (Total Revenue)
4. 营业收入-同比增长 (YOY Growth in Revenue)
5. 营业收入-季度环比增长 (QOQ Growth in Revenue)
6. 净利润-净利润 (Net Profit)
7. 净利润-同比增长 (YOY Growth in Net Profit)
8. 净利润-季度环比增长 (QOQ Growth in Net Profit)
9. 每股净资产 (Net Assets Per Share)

11. 每股经营现金流量 (Operating Cash Flow Per Share)
12. 销售毛利率 (Gross Profit Margin)
13. date (Date)

The data is structured such that each company is represented by four rows, corresponding to four different time periods.

Please upload the factor performance data of different Alpha in the SSE 50 for the period September 30, 2022, to December 31, 2022, so I can proceed with the correlation analysis and prediction.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The first xlsx file corresponds to the performance data for the alpha with index 1. Please use a code analyzer to confirm the table structure and look at the first few rows and columns of each sheet to further understand the structure. I will then upload the presentation data for index 2.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
./data/alpha-result/10.xlsx
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The Excel file for the performance data of the alpha with index 1 contains multiple sheets, each detailing different aspects of the alpha's performance. Here's a brief description of the contents of each relevant sheet:

1. **ic-summary**:
    - Columns: Unnamed: 0, P_1, P_3, P_5
    - Metrics: mean, std (standard deviation), positive occurrences, negative occurrences, significance level

2. **各期分组累计收益率序列 (Group Cumulative Return Series per Period)**:
    - Columns: tag, datetime, P_1, P_3, P_5
    - Contains cumulative returns for different periods and portfolios

3. **各期分组换手率 (Turnover Rate per Period)**:
    - Columns: tag, datetime, P_1, P_3, P_5
    - Provides data on turnover rates for different periods and portfolios

4. **因子累计收益率 (Cumulative Returns of Factors)**:
    - Columns: datetime, P_1, P_3, P_5
    - Contains cumulative returns of the factors over time

5. **最大回撤值 (Maximum Drawdown)**:
    - Columns: Unnamed: 0, 0
    - Provides maximum drawdown values for different portfolios

6. **因子收益率波动率 (Volatility of Factor Returns)**:
    - Columns: Unnamed: 0, 0
    - Contains volatility data for different portfolios

Please upload the performance data for index 2, allowing me to compare and analyze how these factors correlate with the earnings reports for the SSE 50 companies in order to predict the optimal alpha factor for trading in the next quarter.

The second xlsx file corresponds to the performance data for the alpha with index 2. Now use a code analyzer to analyze which alpha performs better, provide sufficient evidence and upload the results using submit_better_alpha_index.

./data/alpha-result/11.xlsx
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Based on the data from both alpha factors, we'll perform a comparative analysis to determine which one performs better. We will focus on key metrics such as mean, standard deviation (std), positive and negative occurrences from the IC summary, cumulative returns, maximum drawdown, and volatility.

### Comparative Analysis

#### IC Summary
- **Alpha 1**:
  - Mean: P_1 (-0.002606), P_3 (-0.028156), P_5 (-0.025957)
  - Std: P_1 (0.130100), P_3 (0.127168), P_5 (0.120783)
  - Positive: P_1 (29), P_3 (28), P_5 (26)
  - Negative: P_1 (32), P_3 (33), P_5 (35)

- **Alpha 2**:
  - Mean: P_1 (-0.010568), P_3 (-0.020368), P_5 (-0.025208)
  - Std: P_1 (0.145610), P_3 (0.126059), P_5 (0.117689)
  - Positive: P_1 (25), P_3 (23), P_5 (25)
  - Negative: P_1 (36), P_3 (38), P_5 (36)

#### Cumulative Returns
- **Alpha 1** has generally higher cumulative returns as seen in both the raw values and the number of positive returns `datetime` entries.
  
- **Alpha 2** seems to lag in cumulative returns across most dates reviewed.

#### Maximum Drawdown
- **Alpha 1** has lower max drawdown values, indicating it experienced smaller peak-to-trough declines.

- **Alpha 2** has higher max drawdown values, particularly notable is the high value in P_1 (0.640151).

#### Volatility
- **Alpha 1**:
  - P_1 Volatility: 0.008848
  - P_3 Volatility: 0.006840
  - P_5 Volatility: 0.005655

- **Alpha 2**:
  - P_1 Volatility: 0.012142
  - P_3 Volatility: 0.007181
  - P_5 Volatility: 0.005681

### Conclusion

Alpha 1 generally outperforms Alpha 2 across key metrics such as lower mean (indicating a closer to zero IC), lower maximum drawdown, and lower volatility. These factors contribute to a lower risk profile and more stable performance, making Alpha 1 a superior choice for trading in the following quarter. 

I will submit the result indicating Alpha 1 as the better performing factor. 

### Upload Results
Let's submit Alpha 1 as the better alpha.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The analysis has been successfully submitted, with Alpha 1 identified as the better performing factor. It demonstrates a better balance of lower mean, lower maximum drawdown, and lower volatility compared to Alpha 2, making it the preferable choice for trading in the next quarter.
