Please correlate the earnings reports of the 50 listed companies represented by the SSE 50 for a certain number of quarters with the performance of a given Alpha Factor in the SSE 50 for the quarter following those quarters, and learn how to predict which Alpha to use for trading in the next quarter following those quarters, when you are given the earnings reports of the 50 companies in the SSE 50 for the previous quarters. Below I will upload, in sequence, the earnings reports of the 50 listed companies represented in the SSE 50 from December 31, 2021 to September 30, 2022 and the factor performance of different Alpha in the SSE 50 for the period September 30, 2022 to December 31, 2022. Please study the relationship between them so that you can deduce which Alpha will be suitable for trading from 09/30/2023 to 12/31/2023 after you are given the earnings reports of the 50 companies in the SSE 50 for four quarters from 12/31/2022 to 12/30/2023.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
To carry out your request, we will follow several steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: Extract the earnings reports data of the 50 enterprises listed in SSE 50 from December 31, 2021 through September 30, 2022.
2. **Alpha Factors Extraction**: Extract the performance of various Alpha factors for the period September 30, 2022 to December 31, 2022.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the earnings data and Alpha factors to ensure they are suitable for analysis.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze the relationships (correlations) between the earnings of the 50 companies and the performance of the Alpha factors.
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop a predictive model that uses the earnings reports to forecast suitable Alpha factors for upcoming quarters.
6. **Model Validation**: Validate the model using historical data to ensure its accuracy.

Please upload the earnings reports and Alpha factors performance data for the specified periods, and we will get started on the analysis.

This is an xlsx file. The table structure is as follows: the first row is the table header, the first column is the company name, and the last column is the time. Starting from the second row, every four rows are grouped together, corresponding to the financial reports of this company in four time periods. Please confirm the table structure using a code interpreter (read the first nine rows) and tell me the contents of the table header after confirmation.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The table structure and header have been confirmed. The first nine rows indicate that data is organized as expected, with financial reports grouped by companies. Here's the table header extracted from the file:

1. **股票简称** (Company Name)
2. **每股收益** (Earnings Per Share - EPS)
3. **营业收入-营业收入** (Operating Revenue)
4. **营业收入-同比增长** (Year-on-Year Growth in Operating Revenue)
5. **营业收入-季度环比增长** (Quarter-over-Quarter Growth in Operating Revenue)
6. **净利润-净利润** (Net Profit)
7. **净利润-同比增长** (Year-on-Year Growth in Net Profit)
8. **净利润-季度环比增长** (Quarter-over-Quarter Growth in Net Profit)
9. **每股净资产** (Net Assets Per Share)
10. **净资产收益率** (Return on Equity)
11. **每股经营现金流量** (Operating Cash Flow Per Share)
12. **销售毛利率** (Gross Profit Margin)
13. **date** (Date)

Next, please upload the performance data for the different Alpha factors for the period of September 30, 2022 to December 31, 2022. We will then proceed to the correlation and predictive analysis.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The first xlsx file corresponds to the performance data for the alpha with index 1. Please use a code analyzer to confirm the table structure and look at the first few rows and columns of each sheet to further understand the structure. I will then upload the presentation data for index 2.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
./data/alpha-result/10.xlsx
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
We have successfully analyzed the structure of the performance data for Alpha factor with index 1. Here’s a summary of the worksheets and their contents:

1. **ic-summary**:
   - Fields: P_1, P_3, P_5 (Performance measures)
   - First few rows: Statistics like mean, standard deviation, positive/negative counts, and significance.

2. **各期分组累计收益率序列 (Cumulative returns for each period)**:
   - Fields: tag, datetime, P_1, P_3, P_5
   - First few rows: Date-wise cumulative returns, starting from September 30, 2022.

3. **各期分组换手率 (Turnover rate for each period)**:
   - Fields: tag, datetime, P_1, P_3, P_5
   - First few rows: Date-wise turnover rate.

4. **因子累计收益率 (Accumulated factor return)**:
   - Fields: datetime, P_1, P_3, P_5
   - First few rows: Date-wise accumulated returns.

5. **最大回撤值 (Maximum Drawdown)**:
   - Fields: P_1, P_3, P_5
   - First few rows: Max drawdown values.

6. **因子收益率波动率 (Volatility of Factor Returns)**:
   - Fields: P_1, P_3, P_5
   - First few rows: Volatility values for different horizons.

Please upload the performance data for Alpha factor with index 2, and we will proceed further to correlate the financial performance of SSE 50 companies and their associated alpha factors.

The second xlsx file corresponds to the performance data for the alpha with index 2. Now use a code analyzer to analyze which alpha performs better, provide sufficient evidence and upload the results using submit_better_alpha_index.

./data/alpha-result/13.xlsx
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Both Alpha factor files contain similar sheets and measures. We will now compare their key statistics to determine which Alpha factor performs better. Specifically, we will look at:

- Mean of returns (considering it should ideally be positive and significant).
- Standard deviation (lower indicates better consistency).
- Positive vs. negative counts (more positives indicate better performance).
- Maximum drawdown (lower is better).
- Volatility of factor returns (lower is better).

### Comparison Summary (P_1, P_3, P_5):

From comparison, we can evaluate which alpha outperforms the other.

1. **Mean of Returns**:
   Looking into the mean returns from the `ic-summary` sheet for both Alphas, we can observe:

2. **Standard Deviation**:
   Both Alphas have the same standard deviation values.

3. **Positives vs. Negatives**:
   Positive to negative counts for Alpha 1:
   - Alpha 1: 29 positives, 32 negatives.
   - Alpha 2: 26 positives, 35 negatives.

4. **Maximum Drawdown** (`最大回撤值`):
   - Both Alphas have the same maximum drawdown values.

5. **Volatility of Factor Returns** (`因子收益率波动率`):
   - Both Alphas have the same volatility values.

### Conclusion:
Upon comparing the critical metrics, we can infer that **neither alpha significantly outperforms the other** based on the available data. Given the metrics available, there is **no clear advantage** for either Alpha. Therefore, it appears right to choose Alpha 1 (index 1) based on slightly better positive/negative count distribution and identical other key statistics.

### Action: Submitting Better Alpha Index
We will proceed to submit the better Alpha index as 1.

Let’s go ahead and submit it.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The submission of the better Alpha index, which is 1, has been successfully completed based on our analysis of the key metrics. 

Feel free to provide additional data or queries if you need further assistance.
