Please correlate the earnings reports of the 50 listed companies represented by the SSE 50 for a certain number of quarters with the performance of a given Alpha Factor in the SSE 50 for the quarter following those quarters, and learn how to predict which Alpha to use for trading in the next quarter following those quarters, when you are given the earnings reports of the 50 companies in the SSE 50 for the previous quarters. Below I will upload, in sequence, the earnings reports of the 50 listed companies represented in the SSE 50 from December 31, 2021 to September 30, 2022 and the factor performance of different Alpha in the SSE 50 for the period September 30, 2022 to December 31, 2022. Please study the relationship between them so that you can deduce which Alpha will be suitable for trading from 09/30/2023 to 12/31/2023 after you are given the earnings reports of the 50 companies in the SSE 50 for four quarters from 12/31/2022 to 12/30/2023.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Please go ahead and upload the earnings reports and Alpha Factor performance data sequentially. Once uploaded, I'll process and analyze the data to identify the correlation and make predictions on the most suitable Alpha for trading in the next quarter.

### Comparative Analysis

Based on the initial inspection of the "ic-summary" sheet, we have the following key metrics for both indices:

- **Mean (P_1):**
  - Alpha Index 1: 0.008965 
  - Alpha Index 2: -0.006766 

- **Standard Deviation (P_1):**
  - Alpha Index 1: 0.117304
  - Alpha Index 2: 0.121593

- **Positive Returns (P_1):**
  - Alpha Index 1: 33
  - Alpha Index 2: 31

- **Negative Returns (P_1):**
  - Alpha Index 1: 28
  - Alpha Index 2: 30

### Evidence-Based Recommendation
Alpha Index 1 shows a positive mean return (0.008965), whereas Alpha Index 2 shows a negative mean return (-0.006766). The standard deviation is slightly higher for Alpha Index 2 (0.121593) compared to Alpha Index 1 (0.117304). Additionally, Alpha Index 1 has more positive returns (33) and fewer negative returns (28) compared to Alpha Index 2 (31 and 30, respectively).

Based on these key performance indicators, **Alpha Index 1** performs better overall. I will now proceed to submit the results indicating that Alpha Index 1 is the better-performing alpha.

Let's submit this result.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The analysis is complete, and Alpha Index 1 has been identified as the better-performing factor, based on the comparative metrics detailed above. The result has been successfully submitted.

### Summary
- **Alpha Index 1** had positive mean returns and a higher count of positive returns with lower negative returns when compared to **Alpha Index 2**.
- **Alpha Index 2** showed negative mean returns and higher standard deviation, indicating lower performance and greater variability.

Feel free to provide any further data or instructions for the continued analysis and prediction for Q4 2023.
