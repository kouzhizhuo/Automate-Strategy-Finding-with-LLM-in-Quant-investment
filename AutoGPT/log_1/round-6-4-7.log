Please correlate the earnings reports of the 50 listed companies represented by the SSE 50 for a certain number of quarters with the performance of a given Alpha Factor in the SSE 50 for the quarter following those quarters, and learn how to predict which Alpha to use for trading in the next quarter following those quarters, when you are given the earnings reports of the 50 companies in the SSE 50 for the previous quarters. Below I will upload, in sequence, the earnings reports of the 50 listed companies represented in the SSE 50 from December 31, 2021 to September 30, 2022 and the factor performance of different Alpha in the SSE 50 for the period September 30, 2022 to December 31, 2022. Please study the relationship between them so that you can deduce which Alpha will be suitable for trading from 09/30/2023 to 12/31/2023 after you are given the earnings reports of the 50 companies in the SSE 50 for four quarters from 12/31/2022 to 12/30/2023.

Please upload the earnings reports of the 50 listed companies represented in the SSE 50 from December 31, 2021 to September 30, 2022, along with the factor performance of different Alpha in the SSE 50 for the period September 30, 2022 to December 31, 2022.

This data will allow me to conduct a comprehensive analysis to study the relationship between the earnings reports and the Alpha factor performance, which will help in predicting the suitable Alpha for trading for the upcoming quarter.

This is an xlsx file. The table structure is as follows: the first row is the table header, the first column is the company name, and the last column is the time. Starting from the second row, every four rows are grouped together, corresponding to the financial reports of this company in four time periods. Please confirm the table structure using a code interpreter (read the first nine rows) and tell me the contents of the table header after confirmation.

The next steps will be to conduct a correlation analysis between these earnings reports and the alpha factor performances. For this, could you please provide the factor performance of different Alphas in the SSE 50 for the period September 30, 2022 to December 31, 2022? Any additional specific Alphas you are interested in?

The first xlsx file corresponds to the performance data for the alpha with index 1. Please use a code analyzer to confirm the table structure and look at the first few rows and columns of each sheet to further understand the structure. I will then upload the presentation data for index 2.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
./data/alpha-result/20.xlsx
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The performance data for the alpha with index 1 includes several sheets with different metrics:

### Sheet Overviews:

1. **ic-summary**: Contains summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, count of positive and negative returns, and significance for different periods (P_1, P_3, P_5).

2. **各期分组累计收益率序列 (Cumulative Returns per Group Period)**: 
    - Columns: tag, datetime, P_1, P_3, P_5
    - Time-series data with cumulative returns for different periods.

3. **各期分组换手率 (Turnover Rate per Group Period)**:
    - Columns: tag, datetime, P_1, P_3, P_5
    - Observes the turnover rates in different periods.

4. **因子累计收益率 (Factor Cumulative Returns)**:
    - Columns: datetime, P_1, P_3, P_5
    - Time-series data showing cumulative returns due to the factor over time.

5. **最大回撤值 (Maximum Drawdown)**:
    - Two columns: Unnamed (Period) and Max. Drawdown values for P_1, P_3, P_5.

6. **因子收益率波动率 (Factor Return Volatility)**:
    - Two columns: Unnamed (Period) and Volatility values for P_1, P_3, P_5.

This data will be used in conjuction with the earnings report data to analyze correlations and make predictions.

Please upload the second file corresponding to the performance data for the alpha with index 2.

The second xlsx file corresponds to the performance data for the alpha with index 2. Now use a code analyzer to analyze which alpha performs better, provide sufficient evidence and upload the results using submit_better_alpha_index.

   - **Alpha 1** has slightly higher volatility, but this is offset by other performance metrics.

### Recommendation:
**Alpha Index 1** outperforms **Alpha Index 2** across essential metrics such as mean returns, maximum drawdown, and cumulative returns stability. Based on these observations, **Alpha Index 1** is the better performing factor. Let's submit the result.

I'll proceed to upload the results using `submit_better_alpha_index`.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The submission for the better-performing alpha, which is Alpha Index 1, has been successfully made.

### Summary:
- **Alpha Index 1** was selected based on superior mean returns, lower maximum drawdown, and more stable cumulative returns.
